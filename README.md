# CRM System for Hotel Management

## Project Description
This graphical CRM system automates processes related to booking and room management. It allows the hotel's internal staff to make advance reservations, monitor guest arrivals, departures, and stays, and track payments. The system integrates various hotel departments (such as booking, housekeeping, and reception) into a single system, enabling data-driven reporting. Its simple interface and intuitive functionality ensure ease and flexibility of use.

  # BACK-END

  Structure: 2 applications. 
- The first application, Continental, was created by Django himself for the configurations and settings of our project and subsequent work with the server. 
- The second application, Hotel, is already the main content of the functionality of the entire project, it was decided not to share the part with the login for easier work with the application itself. Directories with project templates and static files, and pictures, scripts and styles are created inside it.
- New folders were created inside the static and templates directories to store files in them, this was created so that when the project was uploaded and the project was deployed on the hosting, static files and templates of different applications would not mix and there would be an understanding of which applications the files belong to (if additional applications are created in the future). 
- serializers.py â€“ It is necessary to convert data from models to json format for some scripts and functions to work (mainly for the armor placement page).
- urls.py - a file with routes for processing specified requests to the server
- views.py - MTV pattern (Models, Views, Templates) - views that are responsible for how the page requested by the user should look like 
- models.py - a file with data tables, an important part of the CRM system
- forms. py file for working with forms
